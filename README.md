# Python Practice Problems - Algorithmic Patterns

This collection is designed to help you master key algorithmic patterns through progressive difficulty levels.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🟢 Beginner Level
- **Lots of guidance and hints**
- **Detailed explanations of patterns**
- **Step-by-step approach suggestions**
- **Comments explaining every key concept**

### 🟡 Intermediate Level
- **Reduced hints and explanations**
- **Apply patterns more independently**
- **Some guidance on approach**
- **Focus on implementation skills**

### 🔴 Advanced Level
- **Minimal guidance**
- **Challenge your problem-solving skills**
- **Real interview-style problems**
- **Full independence expected**

## 🎯 Covered Patterns

1. **Complexity Analysis** - Big-O notation, time and space complexity
2. **Two-Pointer Technique** - Efficient array/string processing
3. **Sliding Window** - Fixed and variable size windows
4. **Prefix Sums** - Subarray problems and optimizations
5. **Binary Search** - Standard search and answer space search
6. **Hash Maps/Sets** - Frequency counts and quick lookups
7. **Stacks/Queues/Heaps** - Monotonic stacks and heap operations
8. **Linked Lists & Trees** - Basic operations and traversals
9. **Graphs & DP** - BFS/DFS and dynamic programming basics

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start with Beginner** - Read all comments and hints carefully
2. **Progress to Intermediate** - Try to solve with less guidance
3. **Challenge with Advanced** - Test your mastery independently
4. **Review and Repeat** - Come back to reinforce learning

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Understand the pattern first** before coding
- **Draw examples** to visualize the approach
- **Test with edge cases** (empty arrays, single elements, etc.)
- **Analyze time/space complexity** for each solution
- **Practice regularly** - consistency beats intensity

Good luck with your practice! 🎉
