üü¢ BEGINNER LEVEL - Binary Search (Basic)

PROBLEM: Search in Sorted Array
Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, return the index of the target 
if it exists, otherwise return -1.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], target = 7
Output: 3 (because nums[3] = 7)

üéØ ALGORITHMIC PATTERN: Binary Search
This is a binary search problem because:
1. The array is SORTED (key requirement)
2. We're looking for a specific TARGET value
3. We can eliminate half the search space in each step

üí° APPROACH HINTS:
1. Use two pointers: left and right (search boundaries)
2. Calculate middle index: mid = (left + right) // 2
3. Compare nums[mid] with target:
   - If equal: found the target!
   - If nums[mid] < target: search right half (left = mid + 1)
   - If nums[mid] > target: search left half (right = mid - 1)
4. Continue until left > right (target not found)

‚è∞ TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log n) - we halve the search space each time
üíæ SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) - only using a few variables

üîç WHY BINARY SEARCH WORKS:
- Sorted array allows us to make decisions about which half to search
- Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining possibilities
- This is much faster than linear search O(n) for large arrays

üéì LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
After solving this problem, you should understand:
1. How binary search eliminates half the search space each time
2. The importance of maintaining correct loop invariants
3. How to handle boundary conditions (left, right, mid calculations)
4. Why binary search only works on sorted data

üîÑ VARIATIONS TO TRY:
1. Find first/last occurrence of target in array with duplicates
2. Search in rotated sorted array
3. Find peak element in array
4. Search for insertion position (lower_bound/upper_bound)

üìù PRACTICE TIPS:
1. Always verify the array is sorted before applying binary search
2. Be careful with integer overflow: use left + (right - left) // 2 in some languages
3. Pay attention to loop termination conditions (left <= right vs left < right)
4. Test edge cases: empty array, single element, target at boundaries

üß† MENTAL MODEL - Search Space Elimination:
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], Target: 7

Step 1: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]  mid=9 > 7, search left
Step 2: [1, 3, 5, 7]              mid=3 < 7, search right  
Step 3: [5, 7]                    mid=5 < 7, search right
Step 4: [7]                       mid=7 = 7, found!

Each step eliminates ~half of remaining elements!

üîë KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Binary search is a "divide and conquer" algorithm
2. The key insight is that sorted data allows us to make elimination decisions
3. Always maintain the invariant: "if target exists, it's in [left, right]"
4. The algorithm naturally handles the case when target doesn't exist

üí° WHEN TO USE BINARY SEARCH:
- Searching in sorted arrays
- Finding insertion points
- Optimization problems (binary search on answer)
- Any problem where you can eliminate half the possibilities each step
